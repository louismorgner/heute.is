                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why another <i>"productivity"</i> tool? </h2>
                <p class="text-justify text-gray-600">We believe that the quality of one's work is based on the results one achieves on a daily basis. Although there are many existing tools around project management, task planning, and time management, we believe there still is room for a tool that helps users focus their efforts of the day. This project is our attempt to reimagine "productivity" by following the principles of essentialsm, intentionalism and fundamentalism.</p>
